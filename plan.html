      <h4 id="summary">Executive summary</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Balet Hoop is an opportunity for both children and adults to increase their quality of life. It is more than just a ballet studio: it is a creative center of positive energy and healthy way of living. Our main motto is: Mens sana in corpore sano, or A healthy mind in a healthy body. The school doesn't just teach you ballet: it nourishes self-esteem, develops creativity through art and focuses on good posture, which has benefitial effects on skeletal and muscular systems. 
      </br>
      Balet Hoop methods have the potential of spreading beyond the school. Any institution can invite the school to their space and schedule classes with unique programs of either ballet workshops or main programs for adults and children. In the next 7 years, it is the intention of Balet Hoop to create licenced programs and become an educational center for training young ballet pedagogists to teach and spread the program. 
    </br>
    Since the school doesn't attract only ballet lovers, but also anyone who wishes to express themselves creatively and in the process develop a healthy body through adjusted ballet exercises, this business is more profitable than an average ballet studio. Once it becomes a licenced program, it will create job opportunities for graduated ballet dancers. It will raise awareness for art expression, healthy and engaged growing up process of children and maintaining flexibility in adults. It can be a great and innovative way of promotion for institutions which cooperate in any way with the school (through art exibitions of the students, coreographies, festival and concert openings, etc.). 
    </p>

      <h4 id="desc">General Company Description and Services</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Balet Hoop is a school of recreational ballet for children and adults with programs specially developed to encourage and promote healthy habits, creativity and art. It was founded by a former ballet dancer and a pedagogist Marija Jevtić in 2013. Each age group follows a program during 9 months of school year. The programs are written uniquely for this school and developed to fit the purpose of the school. <br>Main programs are ballet for children ages 3 to 11 and ballet for adults. The school offers basics of classical and modern ballet combined with exercises for posture and muscle development. For children, the program also includes coreographies and prop making for different public performances (festivals, concerts etc). Talented children will be encouraged to join primary ballet school Lujo Davičo. For adults, the focus of the classes is on correction any deformities with exercises, maintaining good shape and enjoying dancing without any pressure. </br>There are two special programs which are unique on the market: ballet workshops and program for mothers and daughters. Ballet workshops will be offered as a supplementary program to kindergartens, children institutions, schools or indoor playgrounds, with the goal to advertise the school and its method and programs outside of its location. Chidren institutions would get an interesting additional program, which they can  put on the schedule in frequency which they see fit. Lastly, the program for mothers and daughters is designed for parents who are too busy to go to some type of exercise themselves. The classes are intended for both children and parents, create a strong bond and establish trust during fun activities dancing, exercising etc.

<br>The intention of the school is to license the programs and become an educational center for recreational ballet and art. </p>

<h4 id="marketing">Marketing</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Analysis of the market:</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Ballet classes in Belgrade are offered in several types of places: ballet schools, kindergartens, gyms and exercise halls, dance schools and cultural institutions. According to the analysis of the offer, the classes are advertised in the same way, usually as classes of classical or modern/jazz ballet. Some of the schools give certificates and diplomas at the end of the course, none of which are official, with an exception of ballet school Lujo Davičo, the only offical and accredited institution for ballet dancers. By analysing the offer of the competition deeper, we came to a conslusion that not all places offer the same level of quality of the classes and clients are aware of this. Ballet schools and studios possess the best exercise conditions and teach ballet in a classical manner. Kindergartens and gyms have adjusted programs which only remotely look like ballet classes and have elements of different sport disciplines. The rest of the institutions take ballet less of more seriously, mixing it with other elements like yoga, gymnastics, hip hop dance etc. </br> According to the investigation, there are around 15 ballet schools, not counting Lujo Davičo, which is not our competition, since it is an obligatory education for professional dancers. There are as many various studios located in other institutions advertising ballet classes for adults or children. Seven of those schools are very well established in the market, with good brand, advertising, marketing, good reviews etc. They rely on tradition, good location and brand, while one of the schools relies on the name of a famous Serbian ballerina, who is the founder of the school. However, none of these schools focus on art, creativity or healthy body, but only to ballet basics and dancing. None of them have ballet workshops with potential to spread outside of the school and they don't have a program for mothers and daughters. </br>The competition attracts different customers based on their location, reputation, price and goals. The prices in the city center go up to 60 e per month. Reputable schools which are not in a good location hold a price of around 40 e per month. Price of ballet classes in less famous schools or in the outskirts or the city are around 20 e. The frequency of the classes is usually twice per week. </br>An average Serbian earns around 404 e per month, which doesn't leave much space for spending on hobbies. However, if properly educated about the benefits, they tend to allocate moderate ammount of money for physical exercise like gym memberships, yoga, fitness etc. Based on questionnaire, Serbians value good looks and healthy body and are ready to invest in themselves if the results are going to be visible. For some Serbians, it is a matter of prestige to look nice or have hobbies which are currently popular. Yoga and gym are currently two most popular ways of gaining perfect shape. Many gyms saw this tendency and offered courses of yoga, zumba etc. in their halls. </br>It is very important to notice that many of the potential customers end up in different fields due to dry offer of the ballet studios. Parents opt for sport activities because they believe it will develop their children's bodies better and they understand volleyball better than ballet. Adults choose yoga, as ballet seems complicated and unachievable for them. With many programs on the market like yoga, zumba, gymnastics, pilates etc. audience is confused what will bring them most benefits and end up in a program which is the most popular among their social group. With the right education, we believe we can persuade many female groups that they would benefit from our ballet classes equally as from yoga and, in addition, they would expess themselves in an artistic way, which they wouldn't be able in other classes. </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Analysis of potential clients:</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The clients of Balet Hoop are female ages 3 to 50. According to the last census from 2011, in Belgrade area there are 873.614 women, around 490.000 between the age of 3 and 50. The education of target audience (or their parents, if they are children) is from primary to academic. Their income is between 400 - 800e (average and up). They should have artistic preferences or a desire to create. They understand the value of elegance, healthy lifestyle and like expressing themselves creatively. They are financially and mentally independent, like to spend time and effort on themselves and cherish femininity. Their motives range from fixing mild deformities, staying in shape, dedicating time to a hobby or enjoying dancing. </p>


  <p class="w3-text-grey">Prices:</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Top 5 schools offer classes twice a week for 20 - 60 e a month. Since Balet Hoop doesn't have their own space, but rents space from other institutions and uses their equipment, the price of the classes per month would be 20,4 e. The price would fall in the range of cheaper studios, because the only fixed expense of the school is the rent, which is estimated to be 50% of the monthly earnings. There are no additional costs (electricity, rent, telephone etc.). Balet Hoop offers classes 2 or 3 times per week depending on the age. This price is paid by the students until 5th in a month. There is a discount for parents with 3rd child 5 %, and for paying full membership at the beginning of the school year 10%. The price for Program for mothers and daughters is 25 e a month. There is an increase in the price because it demands work with both the parent and the child. The increase is justified additionally because there is no similar program on the market. The price for ballet workshops is paid per workshop or per month by the institution which hired Balet Hoop. The institution is free to set the price for their clients. Suggested price is 3 e. The fee which the institution should pay for one workshop is 16, 3 e.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Promotion:</p>
       <p class="w3-text-grey">Promotional activities will be undertaken by the owner of the school and by institutions which made a contract with Balet Hoop. </br>The school will have a website and active social media (Facebook and Instagram) to publish news and promotions. Strategic partnership with other business pages and websites can be beneficial for both sides. The network of visitors and people who liked the page on Facebook should be monitored and enlarged by sharing interesting content in the field of physical exercise, healthy diet and lifestyle, ballet, dance etc. and sharing and commenting similar contents of other authors.<br>Before the beginning of school year promotional leaflets should be spread to cultural centers, coffee shops, gyms, schools etc. and potential students. Promotional classes can be held in order to attract new clients and the price can decrease up to 10% for the first month of the school year. Institutions and centers should be contacted by phone and email with prepared written offer for potential partnership. Every public appearance of the students of the school should be taken as promotion as well. </p>

      <h4 id="opplan">Operational Plan</h4>
       <p class="w3-text-grey">
       Right now Balet Hoop is a new, fresh idea with a lot of potential for growth on the market which is full of studios with traditional approach. Currently, the market lacks of any kind of workshop which is based on movement/dance and any program which allows mothers and daughters to exercise together. The goals for Balet Hoop are:<br>
       <br>Short term goals:
       <br>1. Change the location to the city center, to be able to increase the price
       <br>2. Be present in as many locations as possible with ballet workshops
       <br>3. Increase its market share and be one of top 5 schools in Belgrade<br>
       <br> Long term goals:
       <br>1. Become a center for recreational ballet and art
       <br>2. Become a franchise, licence the programs and act as educational center for ballet pedagogists
       <br>3. Promote art and healthy way of living
       </p>
       <p class="w3-text-grey">To estimate better current situation, SWOT analysis is enclosed in the next paragraph.<br>
        <br> Strenghts:
        <br>The owner and the teacher was a professional ballerina, who later dedicated herself to pedagogical work. She has more than 20 years of experience in holding classes and workshops in the fields of art and dance. 
        <br>The school doesn't just advertise ballet, but also promotes healthy exercise and creativity, which makes the offer different from her competitors.<br>
        <br>Weaknesses: 
        <br>The owner is not very experienced in enterpreneurship. 
        <br>Current location is not satisfactory. <br>
        <br>Opportunities:
        <br>Competitors don't offer ballet workshops and Program for mothers and daughters. These programs are the first of such kind on the market.
        <br>
        <br>Threats:
        <br>The competitors have been on the market for a very long time and some of them have good reputation.<br>
        
        <br>How to achieve goals? 
        <br>For short term goals, the school should enter a market as a strong competitor, with good marketing and presence on the Internet promoting what the audience understands the best: benefits for them (perfect shape, strong body, creative expression). The school should seek for partners in good locations to increase its visibility. The school should recognize the benefits for each partner, include them in the offer and make a contract with the new partner, according to which the profit is shared 50/50. The programs should be promoted through advertising techniques (billboards, leaflets, newsletters, blog, social media) and by opportunities to show classes and coreographies to the public. The satisfatcion of the students should be the priority, as they will start recommending the school. When the business reaches that phase, the price can be increased and the owner should prepare programs for acceditation. The final phase is to create a franchise and maintain only the location in the city center, from which the education of the new Balet Hoop teachers will be executed. 
        The main area of vulnerability is financial status of the school. Currently, the school doesn't have any investors nor donations. Without additional funding, the school will not be able to grow and develop into a successful center and franchise. With proper funding and strategic partnerships the school can open job positions, create job opportunities, educate young ballet professionals and promote healthy active life. It can add value to any of its partners (halls, gyms, cultural institutions) as an interesting and innovative program. 
       </p>


      <h4 id="management">Management and Organization</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The owner of the business is Marija Jevtić, former professional ballet dancer and a pedagogist with more than 20 years of experience. Her short CV will be provided to all interested parties. Her role is to be an educator, hold classes and make contracts with partners. Partners will handle the payment of the membership and everything regarding the space. Promotion of the school will be executed by Marija Jevtić, intitutions which became partners with Balet Hoop and occasionally outsource personnel. The location of the studio will not be fixed, however, the programs in all locations will be the same. It will be possible for the partners to hire Balet Hoop for a school year or monthly as an additional program to their activities. The goal is to give an opportunity for as many locations as possible to experience programs of Balet Hoop. Balet Hoop requirements for work are following: clean space with parquet, heating and mirror on one wall, device for playing music and a waiting room for the parents.</p>

    <h4 id="finplan">Financial Plan</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This business doesn't need initial investment or credits to start. The only expense is the rent paid to the partners in the ammount of 50% from income or any other percentage which both sides accept. Another expense is printing the advertising material, which costs up to 50 e for all print materials ideally each 6 months. Website maintenance will be done by the owner. <br>
        However, investment would be the fastest way of growing the business. Any additional income would be used for renting an adequate space, turning it into a recreational center for ballet and art, moving the website to paid hosting and promoting the business on a larger scale. In five years, an investment will be obligatory to turn the business into a franchise. A detailed financial plan should be written for any potential investors to present expenses and income of the business.</p>
