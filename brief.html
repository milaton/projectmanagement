      <h1>Creative Brief</h1>

      <h4>About the organization</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Balet Hoop is a creative ballet school founded in 2013. It offers classes of classical and modern ballet for recreational purposes to children and adults. Our mission is to provide students with the joy of artistic expression and creation, enable proper development of the body and teach them the basics of ballet, while they gain self-confidence and positive self-image. The owner of the studio is Marija Jevtic, ballerina and a pedagogist with more than 20 years of experience. She holds all the classes and workshops.<br>
      Our offer consists of several programs:
      <br>-ballet for children ages 3 to 11
      <br>-ballet for adults
      <br>-ballet workshops for children institutions
      <br>-program for mothers and daughters

      <br>Ballet workshops and Program for mothers and daughters are unique on the market in Belgrade. 

      <br>Ballet workshops are aimed at kindergartens, children institutions, cultural centers, play centers etc. with the goal to promote the school and establish presence in new locations. In this way, the institution which hires Balet Hoop for running ballet workshops will get a new, interesting and fun program for their clients as an extra activity. 
     <br> Program for mothers and daughters is a new way of teaching ballet basics to interested moms, who donâ€™t have much time to dedicate to themselves. This way, they get to exercise while still taking care of their children and spend quality time with their daughters. 
      <br>Ballet for adults and children both have programs which mix physical exercises with basics of classical and modern ballet. The focus is on good posture which helps with muscle and skeletal strenghtening. Younger students are divided into groups according to their age and follow the program which is made based on their abilities. </p>
