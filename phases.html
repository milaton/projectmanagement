      <h1 id="init">Initiation Phase</h1>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">At the beginning of this phase the client and I had a meeting where we discussed about the needs and problems of the studio.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Results of this phase: Project proposal</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Duration: 16th and 17th April</p>

      <h2 id="proposal">Project Proposal</h2>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Project name: Balet Hoop Branding</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Date: 17th April 2017</p>
      <h4>A. Introduction</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Project Balet Hoop Branding will be executed for Marija Jevtić, the owner of the ballet studio Balet Hoop, by Mila Iyibilek, freelance web and graphic designer.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Balet Hoop is a small business founded in 2014. It offers classes of classical and modern ballet for children in a suburban kindergarten and in a Cultural center Banovo Brdo for adults. It has one employee, who is an owner and deals with everything from administration to marketing.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The contractor is a freelance web and graphic designer with knowledge of Project Management, Branding and Marketing, working since 2015.</p>
      <h4>B. Project Scope</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Writing a business plan</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Defining mission, vision and strategy of the studio </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Writing a creative brief</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Copywriting of the website and promotional material</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Designing a logo</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Designing leaflets, a brochure, a poster, diplomas, membership cards, leaflet for ballet workshops and web material for social networks</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Making a website</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Contacting potential partners and promoting the programs of the studio are not in the scope of this project and the client is expected to execute these activities by herself.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Goals of the project:
        <p class="w3-text-grey">-attract new students</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">-move the studio to a better location by offering partnership to institutions with good conditions and interest for ballet classes</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">-establish presence on the Internet</p>
         <p class="w3-text-grey">The success of the project will be measured according to the number of relevant contracts after publishing the promotional material.</p>

      <h4>C. Risk analysis</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">There are several potential problems which can reduce the success of this project. </br>
      1. The current location of the studio is in the outskirts of the city, where there may not be many interested parties for ballet classes. </br>
      2. The school year has already started – potential students and institutions filled their schedules with activities.</br>
      3. The competition is big and most of the studios are on the market for a long time. Their owners have more experience in entrepreneurship and marketing. </br>
      4. The budget is very limited. The client asked for simple promotional material because of printing costs. This is also the reason why the studio is located in an area which is not the best for such business.</br>

      <h4>D. Risk handling</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The project will be finished in a week. Some print material will be designed with less colors to keep the cost minimized. The focus of the project will be on writing good material: business plan, creative brief, programs, advertising material, website content. The project increases the possibility of partnership with an institution which offers better location, so this project is necessary for additional growth and development of Balet Hoop. Finding a partner will also cut the costs for rent and utilities, since the studio will offer to pay a percent from existing income. The website will be developed with Wordpress CMS, where hosting will be free until the studio generates more profit.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The conclusion of the first meeting with the client is that the risk should be taken in order to minimize further financial loss and the project results should be measured and analyzed for further improvement.</p>

      <h4>E. Organization of the project</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The project will be divided into marketing and designing phases, which may overlap. In the marketing phase, the business plan and creative brief should be written along with all the texts for promotional purposes. In the design phase, logo and website should be designed, followed by designing of other print materials. Some tasks should be performed with the involvement of the client, for example writing the Business Plan. This project will be based on the Waterfall method. The deliverables will be delivered until 24th April 2017. The project will last until September 2017.
